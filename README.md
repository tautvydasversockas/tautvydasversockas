### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer from Vilnius, Lithuania. I specialize in back-end technologies with a strong focus on distributed systems and domain-driven design.

I find that the best way to stay up-to-date on software technologies is by participating in various developer community events, conferences, reading books, and writing articles.

I own a software engineering related blog - thehonestcoder.com
