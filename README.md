  About me
</h3>
<p>
I am a tech lead from Vilnius, Lithuania. I specialize in back-end technologies with a strong focus on distributed systems and domain-driven design.

I have a proven track record of building and leading global cross-functional teams.

I own a software engineering blog - <a href="https://thehonestcoder.com/">The Honest Coder</a>

I speak publicly about tech. More info at <a href="https://thehonestcoder.com/meet-me">The Honest Coder</a>

I love travelling. I used to dance bachata and practice Muay Thai. I am now learning to play tennis.

We all have something that keeps us up at night. Coffee is what keeps me up at night... I'm a coffee addict... <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eNwO33cDf7H60uqErv/giphy.gif" width="30">
